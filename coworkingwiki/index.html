			<p>Monday, March 5th, 2012</p>

			<p>Hello,</p>
			
			<p>I'm excited to announce a big initiative to clean up, revamp, upgrade, organize, structure, and just generally over-all improve the coworking wiki.  I've had many conversations with many individuals over the years and I've coalesced everything into a comprehensive plan.  When we got together in LA in the fall we talked about finding a platform that can handle a community as big and diverse as ours.  The key isnâ€™t to find the right software, 
though, (the current Wiki platform is actually a good fit), it's finding the right team. </p>

			<p>Metaphor time!  Software is like an office and offices are boring.  The people in the office are what make it interesting and we have amazing people here.  Of course it takes a little coordination and structure to get everything to flow just right as we all know from running our coworking spaces.  This is what I'm looking to add to the coworking wiki and I can't do it alone. </p>

			<p>I'm starting things off with a fundraiser.  The plan is to raise money to pay a few part-time coordinators for one year.  This will give us time to get everything set in motion so this system can continue past when the money runs out.  The key to make this work is the Wiki Team.  We are looking for five to ten spaces to donate approximately five hours of time per week from a paid staff member eager to be more involved in the movement.  These positions will also be for one year so there is time to try things out and make changes when things don't seem to stick.  </p>

			<p>The Wiki Team will put our best face forward by having real, live, human people available to answer questions, find information, and organize all the collaborative gold we share every day.  They can connect conversations on the google group with information on the wiki and help keep track of our cumulative experience as we share and grow together.</p>

<p>Please <a href="http://vimeo.com/36873380">watch the video</a> and <a href="plan.html">read about the plan</a> to learn more.</p>
