			<h1 style="margin-top:0px">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

			<div style="margin-left: 3em;">

			<h4>Why can't we just install better software or use a better service?</h4>
			<blockquote>
				Any software tool or service has it's own maintenance needs and is going to take work to be kept 
				up to date and organized. We want to focus on building the team of individuals committed to doing that work.
				PBWiki, the software we currently uses, has a lot of the key features we need and we save a lot of work not trying
				to port everything over to something else.  
			</blockquote>

			<h4>How many team members are you looking for?</h4>
			<blockquote>
				There are three coordinators, Jacob Sayles, Chelsea McClain, and Jonathan Yankovich.  
				In addition, We are looking for 5-10 members to form the Wiki Team.
			</blockquote>
			
			<h4>How are the members of the Wiki Team paid?</h4>
			<blockquote>
				Paid staff members of coworking spaces wishing to contribute can donate approximately 5 hours per week
				for one year.  These members will form the Wiki Team.
			</blockquote>
			
			<h4>Why do you want a one year commitment?</h4>
			<blockquote>
				We need time to try things out and see what works and then make adjustments as needed.  We need to move
				beyond the idea that things can be done in a weekend, or as a short-term project.  This doesn't
				provide the ongoing support needed to keep information clean and up to date.  
			</blockquote>
			
			<h4>How much money are you trying to raise?</h4>
			<blockquote>
				We are raising $64,000. The money we raise will provide part-time 
				salaries for 3 coordinators over a one year period as well as some money for light expenses
				and transportation for the full team (coordinators & wiki team) to get together at
				the start of the project.  
			</blockquote>

			<h4>How will you handle the money?</h4>
			<blockquote>
				Jacob Sayles will handle the money.  He is
				incorporating a non-profit in the state of Washington to handle the financial and legal matters.  
			</blockquote>

			<h4>Will my contribution be tax-deductible?</h4> 
			<blockquote>
				No.  We do not have the time, or resources to file for a federal 501(c)(3).
			</blockquote>
			
			<h4>Will we finally be moving away from wiki.coworking.info?</h4> 
			<blockquote>
				Yes.  We will move over to wiki.coworking.com and we're taking care not to break any old links.  There are a lot 
				of sites linking to the wiki and we want to make sure we don't mess those up.
			</blockquote>
